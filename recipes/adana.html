    <p>Kebabs of all kinds are common in Turkish and Middle Eastern cuisines. This particular version is named after the city of Adana in Turkey,
         where it is said to have originated, and is traditionally made of minced lamb mounted on a skewer and grilled over charcoal. </p>

    <p>Different cities and regions debate over how spicy the Adana kebab should be, but the inclusion of ground lamb as the choice of meat is a 
        constant. This recipe seasons the lamb with onion, garlic, cumin, sumac, and red pepper flakes. The cooked kebabs are often served over warm 
        flatbread to catch the drippings and are accompanied by roasted tomatoes, green or red peppers, sliced onions, and parsley. Less traditional, 
        but equally delicious, would be to serve them over a bed of cooked basmati rice or an herbed couscous. </p>
